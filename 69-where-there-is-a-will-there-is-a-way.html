<p>Henry Bond was about ten years old when his father died. His mother found if diffcult to provide for the support of a large family, thus left entirely in her care.</p>
<p>At one time, however, Henry wanted a grammar, in order to join a class in that study, and his mother could not furnish hime with the money to buy it. He was very much troubled about it, and went to bed with a heavy heart, thinking what could be done.</p>
<p>On waking in the morning, he found that a deep snow had fallen, and the cold wind was blowing furiously. "Ah," said he, "it is an ill wind that blows nobody good."</p>
<p>He rose, ran to the house of a neighbor, and offered his service to clear a path around his premises. The offer was accepted. Having completed this work, and received his pay, he went to another place for the same purpose, and then to another, until he had earned enough to buy a grammar.</p>
<p>When school commenced, Henry was in his seat ready to begin the lesson in his new book happily.</p>
<p>From that time, Henry was always the first in all his classes, He knew no such word as fail, but always succeeded in all he attempted. Having the will, he always found the way.</p>
